                Can you answer the basic Chemistry quiz questions? A computer program prepares to accomplish
                a specific task, and it is expected that one knows how to use different languages and algorithms to come
                up with the perfect program for a particular job. Test out your skills by seeing how many questions you
                get right. All the best!
